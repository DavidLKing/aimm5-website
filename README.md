A repo for the 5th American International Morphology Meeting website

Should you want to change something, please do!  Or email/message me to!

The current repo is heavily mocked up from [Eleganter](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page253/eleganter). Big thanks to the [Responsee Team](http://www.myresponsee.com) for open-sourcing that! All copyrighted images in the template should have been replaced.

Everything should also be in accordance with [Ohio State's branding guidelines](https://brand.osu.edu). Note that while the html and css is open-source, the photos are copyrighted by the Ohio State University.
